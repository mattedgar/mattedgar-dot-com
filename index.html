    <h1>Hello, I'm Matt Edgar</h1>
    <p>As service transformation director in NHSX and NHS England, I lead on digital for urgent and emergency care. Outside the NHS, I'm a non-executive board member for Leeds & Yorkshire Housing Association.</p>
    <p>Previously as associate director of design and user research at NHS Digital, I led a professional group of designers, user researchers, content specialists, product managers and delivery managers, and enabled the shift to a product-led operating model.</p>
    <p>I’ve trained civil servants to start with user needs at GDS, and managed products along the adoption curve that led to the world’s first billion smartphones at Orange. I have long experience of hiring, developing and mentoring designers, coaching product teams, and creating the conditions for user-centred, agile delivery.</p>
